## New Media and Research Inspirations

​**​Session Host**​: Hanfang Lyu

### Design Futures in HCI: Design Thinking for Digital Transformation  [Guest Talk]

​**​Speaker​**​: Zhiyong Fu, *Tsinghua University*

​**​Abstract​**​: TBD


### Designing Highly Accessible XR Interfaces [REP]

​**​Speaker​**​: Yang Tian, *Guangxi University*

​**​Abstract​**​: TBD


### Participatory Design in Human-Computer Interaction: Cases, Characteristics, and Lessons

​**​Speaker​**​: Xiang (nathan) Qi, *The Hong Kong Polytechnic University*

​**​Abstract​**​: Participatory Design (PD) has become increasingly prevalent inHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of how PD has beenused by HCI scholars. To bridge this gap, we sampled PD applicationcases (𝑁 = 185) from the SIGCHI conferences over the past decadeand examined these cases through the dimensions of applicationfeatures (e.g., contexts and functions of PD) and PD principles (e.g.,its political commitment and mutual learning principle). Our analysis reveals the various ways PD has been applied in HCI and howits core features have been or have not been manifested in thesecases. Based on these findings, we reflect on the conceptual understanding of PD within the HCI community and discuss potentialmisconceptions. Ultimately, we hope this work can serve as a usefulreference for HCI researchers and beyond who are interested inincorporating PD into their design and research practices.


### SeQR: A User-Friendly and Secure-by-Design Configurator for Enterprise Wi-Fi

​**​Speaker​**​: Sze Yiu Chau, *The Chinese University of Hong Kong*

​**​Abstract​**​: A classic problem in enterprise Wi-Fi is client-side misconfiguration, which enables credential theft via 鈥淓vil Twin鈥?(ET) attacks. To mitigate this, we design, develop, and evaluate a new configurator, SeQR, which allows users to effortlessly and securely set up an enterprise Wi-Fi connection. Utilizing existing authenticated channels, SeQR fully automates the client-side enterprise Wi-Fi configuration process with a simple scan, leaving no room for misconfigurations. Specifically, SeQR thwarts ET by making it impossible for users to opt-out from the security-critical certificate validation. We evaluate the efficacy of SeQR on two fronts. First, we implement a prototype of SeQR in Android, and test its functionality and runtime performance. Next, we compare the usability of SeQR against two existing Wi-Fi configuration interfaces of Android in an in-person user study (n=41) with real devices. Our evaluation shows that SeQR achieves noticeable usability improvements over existing designs, and prevents users from misconfiguring.


<!-- ### Using Affordance to Understand Usability of Web3 Social Media

​**​Speaker​**​: Maggie Yongqi Guan, *University of Macau*

​**​Abstract​**​: Web3 social media refers to a new generation of platforms built on decentralized technologies, particularly blockchain. Although academia has investigated the newly emerging Web3 social media, it is not clear how users perceive the usability of such platforms and how these perceptions are influenced by the inherent characteristics of Web3. To address this gap, we utilize affordance theory to explore the unique usability of Web3 social media compared with Web2 social media. We conducted interviews with 32 participants who are experienced with Web3 social media and examined the affordances of Web3 social media from the perspectives of content creation, content consumption, and community interaction. We further discuss the correlation between the usability of Web3 social media and the underlying decentralized technology, and provide design implications for enhancing the usability of this new type of social interaction platform. -->
