## Healthcare and Human Wellbeing

​**​Session Host**​: Liangwei Wang

### Empathy-Driven Interaction Design [Guest Talk]

​**​Speaker​**​: Wei Liu, *Southern University of Science and Technology*

​**​Abstract​**​: Empathy is a fundamental principle in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), shaping the design of intuitive, inclusive, and emotionally resonant experiences. This talk introduces Empathy-Driven Interaction Design (EDID), a human-centered framework that integrates psychological insights, interaction qualities, and experiential design to improve usability and accessibility. Applications in assistive technology, user-friendly interfaces, and emotion-aware systems will be explored, demonstrating how empathy can be systematically embedded in design processes. Case studies and research will highlight strategies for fostering deeper user engagement and creating meaningful interactions that go beyond functionality to establish genuine user connections.


### A Constructed Response: Designing and Choreographing Robot Arm Movements in Collaborative Dance Improvisation

​**​Speaker​**​: Ray Lc, *City University of Hong Kong*

​**​Abstract​**​: In dance, dancers improvise and choreograph with each other, prototyping movement designs with each other. These interactions extend into collaboration with technology to enhance the creative process. We want to understand how dancers design and improvise movements together in the case of working with a robotic arm, which serves as an instrument in the stage space capable of non-humanoid movements. We engaged and observed dancers in a workshop to co-create movements with robots in one-human-to-one-robot and three-human-to-one-robot settings. We found that dancers produced more fluid movements in one-to-one scenarios, experiencing a stronger sense of connection and presence with the robot as a co-dancer. Conversely, in three-to-one scenarios, the dancers divided their attention between the human dancers and the robot, resulting in increased perceived use of space and more stop-and-go movements, perceiving the robot as part of the stage background. This work highlights how technologies can drive creativity in movement artists as they adapt to new ways of working with instruments, extending prior research on dancing with inanimate objects by exploring how robotic arms influence creative collaboration. We contribute insights into designing systems that support improvisational processes and artistic collaborations with non-humanoid agents.


### Human-Precision Medicine Interaction: Public Perceptions of Polygenic Risk Score for Genetic Health Prediction

​**​Speaker​**​: Yuhao Sun, *University of Edinburgh*

​**​Abstract​**​: Precision Medicine (PM) transforms the traditional "one-drug-fits-all" paradigm by customising treatments based on individual characteristics, and is an emerging topic for HCI research on digital health. A key element of PM, the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), uses genetic data to predict an individual's disease risk. Despite its potential, PRS faces barriers to adoption, such as data inclusivity, psychological impact, and public trust. We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore how people perceive PRS, formed of surveys (n=254) and interviews (n=11) with UK-based participants. The interviews were supplemented by interactive storyboards with the ContraVision technique to provoke deeper reflection and discussion. We identified ten key barriers and five themes to PRS adoption and proposed design implications for a responsible PRS framework. To address the complexities of PRS and enhance broader PM practices, we introduce the term Human-Precision Medicine Interaction (HPMI), which integrates, adapts, and extends HCI approaches to better meet these challenges.


### Designing and Evaluating a Narrative-driven Spatial Visualization for Improving Patient-centered Communication among Older Adults

​**​Speaker​**​: Jiaan Li, *Hong Kong Polytechnic University*

​**​Abstract​**​: With the aging population, older adult patients experience difficulties in communicating and understanding medical information within healthcare settings. This late-breaking work focuses on designing and evaluating narrative-driven spatial visualization (N-dSV) through conducting iterative participatory design with clinicians and older adults. The results indicate that compared with the traditional paper-based mode, this innovative information communication mode can significantly improve older adults鈥?understanding of medical information and have a higher willingness to use it, thus improving the patient-centered communication experience. Finally, we propose three design implications to provide references for research in the HCI field to optimize patient-centered communication in medical scenarios by using narration-driven spatial visualization as a framework.


### Walk in Their Shoes to Navigate Your Own Path: Learning About Procrastination Through A Serious Game

​**​Speaker​**​: Runhua Zhang, *The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology*

​**​Abstract​**​: Procrastination, the voluntary delay of tasks despite potential negative consequences, has prompted numerous time and task management interventions in the HCI community. While these interventions have shown promise in addressing specific behaviors, psychological theories suggest that learning about procrastination itself may help individuals develop their own coping strategies and build mental resilience. However, little research has explored how to support this learning process through HCI approaches. We present ProcrastiMate, a text adventure game where players learn about procrastination's causes and experiment with coping strategies by guiding in-game characters in managing relatable scenarios. Our field study with 27 participants revealed that ProcrastiMate facilitated learning and self-reflection while maintaining psychological distance, motivating players to integrate newly acquired knowledge in daily life. This paper contributes empirical insights on leveraging serious games to facilitate learning about procrastination and offers design implications for addressing psychological challenges through HCI approaches.


### Customizing Emotional Support: How Do Individuals Construct and Interact With LLM-Powered Chatbots

​**​Speaker​**​: Xi Zheng, *City University of Hong Kong*

​**​Abstract​**​: Personalized support is essential to fulfill individuals' emotional needs and sustain their mental well-being. Large language models (LLMs), with great customization flexibility, hold promises to enable individuals to create their own emotional support agents. In this work, we developed ChatLab, where users could construct LLM-powered chatbots with additional interaction features including voices and avatars. Using a Research through Design approach, we conducted a week-long field study followed by interviews and design activities (N = 22), which uncovered how participants created diverse chatbot personas for emotional reliance, confronting stressors, connecting to intellectual discourse, reflecting mirrored selves, etc. We found that participants actively enriched the personas they constructed, shaping the dynamics between themselves and the chatbot to foster open and honest conversations. They also suggested other customizable features, such as integrating online activities and adjustable memory settings. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for enhancing personalized emotional support through emerging AI technologies.


### "Becoming My Own Audience": How Dancers React to Avatars Unlike Themselves in Motion Capture-Supported Live Improvisational Performance

​**​Speaker​**​: Fan Zhang, *City University of Hong Kong*

​**​Abstract​**​: The use of motion capture in live dance performances has created an emerging discipline enabling dancers to play different avatars on the digital stage. Unlike classical workflows, avatars enable performers to act as different characters in customized narratives, but research has yet to address how movement, improvisation, and perception change when dancers act as avatars. We created five avatars representing differing genders, shapes, and body limitations, and invited 15 dancers to improvise with each in practice and performance settings. Results show that dancers used avatars to distance themselves from their own habitual movements, exploring new ways of moving through differing physical constraints. Dancers explored using gender-stereotyped movements like powerful or feminine actions, experimenting with gender identity. However, focusing on avatars can coincide with a lack of continuity in improvisation. This work shows how emerging practices with performance technology enable dancers to improvise with new constraints, stepping outside the classical stage.
